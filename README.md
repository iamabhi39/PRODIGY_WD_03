## Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application
<---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>I build a tic-tac-toe web application, I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By implementing functions to handle user clicks, track game state, and check for winning conditions, you can create an interactive and engaging tic-tac-toe game. With these technologies and functionalities, users can play against each other or against an AI opponent, aiming to get three markers in a row to win the game. </p>

<p> Languages Used: HTML, CSS, & JavaScript </p>
